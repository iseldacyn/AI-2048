# AI-2048

Extension of my [CS451 course project](https://github.com/sophiacarlone/2048-AI), creating an AI that plays 2048.

UPDATE: I will be infrequently contributing to this project for the time being.
I am undecided whether I should rewrite the project in Rust (as a small project), or continue with large documentation in C++.
Expect little updates to this project for the months to come.
